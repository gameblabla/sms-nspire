SMS_Plus for Ti Nspire CX Final Version
_______________________________________

Port by gameblabla


Here is a port of SMS_Plus for Ti Nspire CX.
All the games compatible with SMS_Plus should work on this port, albeit without sound. (makes sense, it's a calculator)

To play Game Gear games properly, they must have the .gg.tns or else SMS_Plus will play them in Master System mode,
which will screw up the palette.

Previous version was not properly centered : this version fixes this and it's a bit faster too.
