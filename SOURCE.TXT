
 To compile:

 PSX: You'll need to make an archive file called 'libpsx.a' with the
      'syscall.o' and '_start.o' objects added. These come with mipsgcc.

      You may get better performance using another compiler like psyq,
      since currently mipsgcc crashes when trying to compile the Z80
      emulator with any optimization level higher than -O1. I'm not
      sure if this is a limitation of the compiler or simply a memory
      problem. (too small stack size for the compiler executable)

 DOS: You'll need Allegro, SEAL and zlib. The fileutils package is needed
      for the 'clean' target in the makefile.
